# morphometrixnonadult
osteoarchaeology dissertation project


My BSc dissertation looks at non-adult sex estimation techniques. I have here a set of images of the hip bones from around 65 individuals from the York Fishergate House Skeletal Collection housed at Durham University. The auricular surface as a sex predictor has been investigated by Luna et al. 2017 using statistical methodologies on metric traits from images. I am now keen to develop a machine learning method to classify my data to take this model and approach one step further.
